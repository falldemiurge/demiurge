# demiurge
### introduction
I'm known professionally as the demiurge, but I'm fine with being called fall or dahlia.\
I enjoy improving on my creative fields, such as writing, music, and painting.\
I've a serious thirst for knowledge, mostly in fields related to philosophy and logic.\
I'm a fan of genres like midwest emo, grunge, post-rock, and some folk subgenres.
