# demiurge
### introduction
I'm the *demiurge*, also called *fall* or *dahlia*.\
I enjoy improving on my creative fields, such as writing, music, and painting.\
I've a serious thirst for knowledge, mostly in fields related to philosophy and logic.\
I'm a fan of genres like midwest emo, grunge, post-rock, and dark folk (not talking about black people here).\
that's all
